# Household and seasonal

The work that has no deadline until suddenly it has a very short one. Camp
registration opens and closes in a week. The first cold day arrives and the
snow boots are a size too small. School closes for eleven days in December and
nobody arranged coverage.

Read `~/.mrs-doubtfire/config.md` first. Household details live in the data
folder, at `<data folder>/household.local.md`.

## Housing type

Housing type comes from config. If config does not say, ask. Each type
constrains different work.

| Type | What it constrains |
|---|---|
| Rental | Landlord approval for changes, lease terms, renewal and notice dates |
| Co-op | House rules, board approval, alteration agreements |
| Condo | Building rules, association approval, permitted work windows |
| House | Exterior, roof, gutters, yard, driveway, none of which an apartment has |

Building and association rules constrain more than people expect. Read the
rules before assuming anything is permitted, and cite the specific rule when
stating a constraint.

## Camp and afterschool registration

The highest-stakes seasonal item, because it combines a hard open date, fast
sellouts, real money, and the consequence of an uncovered summer.

**Summer camp registration usually opens January to February.** Popular
programs sell out in days, some in hours. The window varies by market, so
verify the actual open date for each program rather than assuming last year's.

**Decide what the child is doing in December**, before registration opens, not
in March when somebody notices summer is coming.

Sequence:

1. **December**: decide what the child is doing. This is a conversation between
   the parents, not a task Mrs. Doubtfire resolves. Surface it as a decision
   with options.
2. Confirm the exact registration open date and time for each program. Search
   for it; do not assume last year's date.
3. Set a task with a reminder for the open time itself, highest priority.
4. Confirm the login works the day before, and that a payment method is ready.
5. Register at open. Do not browse first.
6. Deposit at registration.
7. Calendar the forms and physical deadline, usually 6 weeks before the session.
8. Buy the required gear from the packing list.

Afterschool and enrichment enrollment opens in August for fall and December for
spring. Same discipline, lower stakes.

## Childcare coverage for school closures

Every school closure is a coverage problem. When the school calendar is
ingested, produce a consolidated list of every closure with the coverage status
for each: covered, uncovered, or needs a decision.

The big ones: winter break (2+ weeks), spring break, any mid-winter break, and
the gap between the last day of school and the first day of camp. **That gap is
routinely a week or two and routinely forgotten.**

Route coverage to `childcare and camp`.

## Seasonal swaps

**Late September** and **late March**. Each swap:

- Clothes: run the seasonal audit from the health-growth skill. Outerwear and
  shoes get checked first, they are what becomes urgent overnight.
- Home: window treatments, humidifier, heavy bedding, and window AC units where
  the building governs them. Check `<data folder>/household.local.md`.
- Gear: snow gear in September before it sells out, rain gear in March.
- Storage: what gets boxed, what gets donated.
- Houses only: gutters, outdoor faucets, storm prep, yard closeout in fall and
  yard opening in spring.

## Holiday planning

| Holiday | Decide by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Thanksgiving | Early September | Lock travel dates before fares climb |
| Winter break | September | 2+ weeks of coverage or travel. The biggest single planning item of the year |
| Winter holiday gifts | Start Nov 1, done by Dec 10 | Shipping cutoffs are real |
| Spring break | December | Travel or coverage |
| Summer | December | Camp registration forces the timeline |

The pattern: every holiday decision has to be made roughly a full season before
the holiday, because travel and registration both close early.

## Recurring home maintenance

Track in `<data folder>/household.local.md`. The standing set:

| Item | Cadence | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| HVAC filter | Quarterly | All |
| Smoke and CO detector batteries | Twice a year, at the daylight saving changes | All |
| Deep clean | Quarterly | All |
| Renters or homeowners insurance review | Annual | All |
| Window AC units in / out | May and October | Apartments with window units |
| Building or landlord work approvals | Before any work | Rental, co-op, condo |
| Gutters, exterior, yard | Spring and fall | House |

## Routing

Route by logical name. The mapping from name to project or list lives in
config; see `reference/task-routing.md`. Never hardcode a project name or ID.

| Item | Route |
|---|---|
| Camp and afterschool registration, coverage | `childcare and camp` |
| Home, maintenance, building, seasonal | `household` |
| Clothes, gear, supplies | `shopping` |
| Camp deposits and tuition | `money` |
| Holiday hosting and gifts | `social and gifts` |

Tag `doubtfire` + `household`.
