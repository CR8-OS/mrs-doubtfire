# Mrs. Doubtfire

<img src="mrs-doubtfire.jpg" alt="Mrs. Doubtfire peeling back the mask to reveal a Terminator endoskeleton underneath" width="560">

A Claude plugin that keeps track of the family logistics that fall through.

School deadlines. The dentist nobody has booked in fourteen months. Camp
registration that opens and closes in a week. Flights that should have been
booked two months ago and now cost four hundred dollars more. The birthday party
you RSVP'd to and forgot to buy a gift for.

None of it is hard. All of it is invisible until it is late.

Once a week this tells you what is coming, what is about to get expensive, and
what you are already behind on. It writes the actions into whatever task manager
you already use, and it can publish a page showing the week ahead that you can
send to your partner.

---

## What it actually does

**Works backwards from deadlines.** Nothing gets scheduled on the day it is due.
Every obligation gets a lead time, and the task lands on the date when acting is
still cheap. Camp registration goes on the calendar in December, not March.

**Surfaces the second task.** A party invitation is not one thing, it is four:
RSVP, gift, ride, and a calendar block so nothing else lands there. Most family
failures live in items two through four.

**Tells you the uncomfortable part.** If a registration window closed, it says
so. If fares are climbing, it says by how much. If you have been sitting on
something for three weeks, it names it.

**Never invents a fact about your family.** Sizes, dates, provider names, past
appointments — these come from your files or from you. If something is missing
or stale, it says so and asks. A confidently wrong shoe size is worse than no
shoe size, because you will act on it.

## Install

This repo is its own marketplace, so you add it once and install from it.

**In Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add CR8-OS/mrs-doubtfire
/plugin install mrs-doubtfire@cr8os-family
```

**In the Claude desktop app**, once the marketplace above is added: click the
**+** next to the prompt box, choose **Plugins → Add plugin**, and pick
Mrs. Doubtfire from the browser.

Worth knowing: the desktop plugin browser lists plugins from marketplaces you
have already configured. Adding a *new* marketplace may still need the
`/plugin marketplace add` line above, run once. If you are sending this to
someone who does not use a terminal, check that first rather than assuming, or
just send them the packaged `.plugin` file and let them click install.

Updating later:

```
/plugin marketplace update cr8os-family
```

## Setup

Once installed, say **"set up Mrs. Doubtfire"**. Nothing prompts you — you have
to ask.

Six questions, about two minutes:

1. Connect a folder — it keeps everything there, so pick a synced one
2. Who is in the household, and the kids' birthdates
3. Which school, and what address it emails from
4. What you use to track tasks — or nothing, which works fine
5. Which domains to track
6. When you want the weekly brief

That writes `config.md` into the folder you connected. It is plain markdown and
you can edit it by hand any time, which is the point — you should never have to
ask an AI to change a fact about your own family.

### Then do these three things

Everything else degrades gracefully. These three do not.

**Feed it your school calendar.** Forward the PDF, paste the dates, point at the
file. Closures, coverage gaps, trip windows and every deadline calculation come
from it. Without one the whole school domain is guessing.

**Fill in the last dentist visit and last check-up.** Two dates. Nothing can be
called overdue until something knows when it last happened, so until these exist
the medical side stays silent.

**Make a mail label called `doubtfire`**, plus a `doubtfire/done` sub-label.
Anything you label gets picked up on the next run and treated as deliberate,
outranking every keyword guess. It is how the things a search would never have
found still get caught. Thirty seconds, and the highest-leverage minute here.

### What the first week feels like

Thin, and then not. Before you feed it anything it knows nothing about your
family, and it says so rather than filling the gap with plausible guesses.

That is the honest cost of a tool that refuses to invent facts about your
children. Give it a calendar and two dates and the Sunday brief starts earning
its place.

---

## The domains

Turn off anything you do not want. Off means silent.

| Domain | Covers |
|---|---|
| **School** | Calendar ingestion, forms, deadlines, conferences, re-enrollment |
| **Medical** | Appointment cadence, overdue checks, growth and clothing sizes |
| **Travel** | Trips, booking windows, passports, the school-calendar boundary |
| **Social** | Parties, RSVPs, gifts, reciprocity, date nights |
| **Household** | Camp and afterschool registration, seasonal work, maintenance |
| **Special education** | IEP, 504, evaluation timelines. Off by default. |

---

## What you need

**Required:** Claude, and a folder to keep data in.

**Strongly recommended:** a mail connector. Most of what this finds arrives by
email, and without it you are typing things in by hand.

**Optional but good:** a calendar connector, so it knows whether you are
actually free before proposing a date. A task manager, so commitments land
somewhere durable. Pick `none` and the brief simply reports instead of writing.

It degrades honestly. Anything not connected gets named, along with what that
costs you, rather than silently producing a thinner answer.

---

## Where your data lives

**Nothing personal is in this repo, and nothing personal is sent anywhere.**

Skill logic lives here, on GitHub, versioned. Your family's actual data lives in
the folder you chose during setup — school calendar, sizes, medical dates,
reciprocity ledger. Those files are yours, they stay on your machine and your
own cloud drive, and they are gitignored.

The one deliberate exception is the week-ahead page, which is a hosted artifact
so you can send it to your partner. It is opt-in, it is private until you share
it, and it carries schedule information only — no addresses, no phone numbers,
no medical detail beyond the fact of an appointment.

## Structure

```
skills/
  setup/              first-run onboarding, writes your config
  mrs-doubtfire/      the router and the operating doctrine
  school-ops/         calendar ingestion, deadlines, conferences, IEP
  health-growth/      medical cadence, sizes, seasonal buying
  travel-planner/     booking windows, passports, trip logistics
  social-calendar/    parties, gifts, reciprocity, date nights
  household-seasonal/ camp, afterschool, seasonal, maintenance
  weekly-brief/       the recurring scan and the week-ahead page

reference/
  lead-times.md            how far ahead everything has to happen
  task-chains.md           the second-order tasks
  task-routing.md          where commitments land, and what a good task looks like
  data-sources.md          reading files and mail safely
  week-ahead-artifact.md   the weekly page: spec and template

data/
  config.template.md       the household config
  *.template.md            scaffolds copied into your folder at setup
```

The two files worth reading if you want to understand the thing:
`reference/lead-times.md` and `reference/task-chains.md`. They are the accumulated
answer to "how far ahead does this actually need to happen", and they are useful
even if you never install this.

---

## Making it yours

Everything here is markdown. Open a skill and edit it.

The lead times are a starting point, not gospel — venue booking windows and camp
registration dates vary a lot by city, and if yours are different, change the
table. The task chains are the same: if your family has a step that always gets
missed, add it.

Pull requests welcome, particularly for lead times in other cities and school
systems, and for task managers not yet supported.

---

## If you are one of the first people trying this

Setup has been written carefully and reviewed, but it has not been run by many
people yet. Something will be wrong. Tell me where it breaks rather than working
around it — a confusing question, a step that did nothing, a place you weren't
sure what it wanted. That is more useful than a bug report about the code.

Two known rough edges:

**Nothing announces setup.** You have to say "set up Mrs. Doubtfire". If you
install it and start asking family questions first, it will not know anything.

**The desktop install path is less tested than the terminal one.** If the plugin
browser will not add the marketplace, ask whoever sent you this for the
packaged `.plugin` file instead — it installs with a click and needs no
terminal.

---

## Credit

The idea is **Sam Dolgin's** — friend, neighbor, and fellow dad, who worked out
that the hard part of parenting logistics is not doing the thing, it is knowing
about the thing early enough for doing it to be cheap.

Everything here is an implementation of that observation. Thanks, Sam.

## A note on the name and the picture

Named after the film, affectionately. No affiliation with anyone who owns
anything related to it, and no commercial use intended.

The header is a fan edit of a still from the 1993 film, which belongs to its
studio, not to this project. It is here as a joke about what the plugin does,
and it comes down on request.

The character got the job done by being competent and slightly relentless rather
than by being nice about it, which is roughly the design brief.
